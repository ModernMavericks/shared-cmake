# The artifacts cannot answer this on their own: golang's native .pkg carries the CA bundle and the
# legacy-support shim, its cross .pkg legitimately does not (cross-built apps look at the native
# prefix). "Both variants used the same shim" is a claim about inputs, and inputs are only knowable
# at build time -- so write them down here rather than trying to reconstruct them later.
#
# Keys are free-form; conformance compares any key that appears in more than one variant, except the
# ones that are SUPPOSED to differ (variant, arch, prefix, pkg, identifier).
#   usage: build-info.sh <outfile> key=value [key=value ...]
