# Gate a BUILT .pkg against the two install-time footguns build_component_pkg.sh disables, by reading
# what the .pkg ACTUALLY declares in its PackageInfo -- so a regression (a product that bypassed the
# helper, or a future pkgbuild default change) fails CI instead of shipping and being discovered live
# on a user's machine, weeks later, one product at a time.
#
# Every check in the family so far has verified that artifacts AGREE with each other; none exercised
# what the installer DOES on a machine that already has the previous version. That is the gap every
# install-time bug fell through. This gate closes it for relocation + version-skip.
#
# For every component PackageInfo inside the .pkg, asserts (both verified empirically against real
# pkgbuild output, 2026-07-31 -- pkgbuild encodes these differently than one might guess):
#   - <relocate> lists NO bundles       => BundleIsRelocatable=false  (installs at the declared path).
#       NB: the pkg-info root's relocatable="false" ATTRIBUTE is a red herring -- pkgbuild emits it even
#       for a relocatable component; the <relocate> ELEMENT's membership is the operative signal.
#   - <bundle-version> lists NO bundles => BundleIsVersionChecked=false (always overwrites; pkgbuild
#       files a version-checked bundle under <bundle-version>, NOT under <upgrade-bundle>, which lists
#       every upgradable bundle regardless of the flag).
# A relocatable / version-checked bundle appears as <bundle id="..."/> under those elements. A clean
# pkg leaves them empty (<relocate/> / <bundle-version/>) or absent.
